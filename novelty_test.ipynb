The police teams, which kickstarted their anti-Romeo drive in neighbouring cities like Meerut, Ghaziabad, Kanpur, and Noida from March 23, sent shivers down the spines of young boys and girls. The youth voiced their concern, saying that the police, on the name of anti-Romeo drive, was harassing the innocent lot. \\\\nWhile the crackdown continues on the young students in Ghaziabad with over 45 persons nabbed by the police so far, Delhiites have a mixed tone on the issue when asked whether the national capital should have its own anti-Romeo squad. \\\\nChandani Mathur, an aspiring management student, is of the opinion that the national capital should have a check on the anti-social elements as the city has a dubious name when it comes to the safety and security of the women and children. \\\\u201cThe city police must act against the miscreants who are on the loose in the streets and try to outrage the modesty of a woman. They should be dealt with sternly. The state government should take a cue from their neighbouring state and act accordingly,\\\\u201d she said. \\\\nSince the much hyped anti-Romeo drive began in Uttar Pradesh, there has been a heavy crackdown on eve teasers.

What is a worrisome factor is that the police will abuse its power and harass the innocent lot,\\\\u201d he rued. \\\\nAccording to Naina Kumar, a 26-year-old girl who works in a private firm in Delhi, if the drive is started, it will become an uphill task for youngsters and working professionals to take a stroll on the street or sit in a coffee joint or in a cafe. \\\\u201cHow humiliating it would be if you are hanging out with your brother or distant cousin and are stopped and checked by the police, to whom you have to explain your relationship,\\\\u201d she said. \", \"source\": [\"\\\\nAmid outrage over the way Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath\\'s anti-Romeo squads have punished loitering men on the streets, the police has issued fresh guidelines for these groups who are allegedly trying to \\\\\"protect the modesty of women.\\\\\" \\\\nNDTV reports that these squads have been told there will be no shaving of hair, blackening of the face or murga punishment or even uthak baithak. \\\\nDirector General of Police Javeed Ahmed gave these directions in a letter to the police. \\\\nNDTV also quoted the letter as saying, \\\\\"Couples sitting in public places should not be asked for IDs, questioned, frisked or humiliated.\\\\\" \\\\nIt was reported earlier this week that the anti-Romeo squads were also targeting people for certain castes. \\\\nMany had complained of being harassed by the squads who had till now been frisking men. \\\\nCongress MP Ranjeeta Ranjan had raised this issue in Parliament, saying the youth in Uttar Pradesh were being harassed.
